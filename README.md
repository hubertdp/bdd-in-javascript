# BDD in Javascript

Repository for Todd Anderson's excellent BDD tutorial.

The only difference with [Todd's repository](https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-examples), and the reason for this repo, is that this repo uses newer versions of npm, cucumberjs etc.

I'm using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage npm.

This repo is using node v6.9.1 (npm v3.10.8).

Each commit corresponds to a part of the tutorial:

  - part-one -> [https://custardbelly.com/blog/blog-posts/2014/01/08/bdd-in-js-cucumberjs/index.html](https://custardbelly.com/blog/blog-posts/2014/01/08/bdd-in-js-cucumberjs/index.html)

Hope you learn as much as I did.

Many thanks to Todd Anderson for this really great tutorial!
